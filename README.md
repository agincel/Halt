# Pause
Unity2D Project for SGDC's Winter Jam 2016: "One Input"

A reboot of the basic concept from Pause (2015), a 2D First Person Platforming Puzzle game made in Unreal Engine 4. 

In Pause, an object moves throughout the world. The player can pause and unpause various moving pieces in the world in order to navigate that object to a goal. Rotating platforms, falling and rolling pieces, and elevators all move while time is flowing, but can be frozen in place at a moment's notice.

# Pause
Unity2D Project for SGDC's Winter Jam 2016: "One Input"

A reboot of the basic concept from Pause (2015), a 2D First Person Platforming Puzzle game made in Unreal Engine 4. An object moves throught the world. The player can pause and unpause various moving pieces in the world to navigate the object to the goal.
